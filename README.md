cat
===
The Unix cat utility in many different languages. A teaching exercise.

Why?
----
Hello World is the traditional first program that is written by budding
programmers. However, the program isn't very useful. And it's not supposed to
be.

cat is probably one of the easier utilities to understand and write that is
actually used. Additionally, it is sufficiently complex enough to have multiple
ways of writing it within any particular language, allowing the new programmer
to impart his or her own developing style to the code. Finally, cat has special
conditions that require a little extra thought. A programmer could choose to
omit the code for handling stdin for a simplified program, for example.

The aspiring programmer will have a program he or she will use on a regular
basis. That feeling of using what you make hopefully provides encouragement to
continue learning to program.

Get involved
------------
Want to help herd cats? Write your own version of cat. Any language will do! In
fact, multiple examples of each language is good for demonstrating different
styles.
